Why does salt melt ice on the road during winter?,"Salt lowers the freezing point of water, a process known as freezing point depression. When salt is added to ice, it dissolves into the thin layer of liquid water always present on the ice surface, forming a brine with a lower freezing point than pure water. As a result, the ice melts even though the temperature is below 0°C."
"What is wrong with this Python code and how can I fix it?

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[3]) ","The code raises an IndexError because list indices in Python start at 0, so my_list[3] is out of range. The valid indices are 0, 1, 2.
✅ Fix:

print(my_list[2])


or

for item in my_list:
    print(item)"

Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning. ,"In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data — each input has a known output (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam).
In unsupervised learning, models are trained on unlabeled data and must discover hidden structures or patterns by themselves (e.g., clustering customers by purchasing behavior). "
